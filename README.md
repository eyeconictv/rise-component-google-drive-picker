# Google Drive Picker [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/Rise-Vision/component-google-drive-picker/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Rise-Vision/component-google-drive-picker/tree/master)

## Introduction

Google Drive Picker is an Angular directive that provides a button to launch the [Google Picker](https://developers.google.com/picker/docs/) modal so a user can select a file based on a file type (eg. spreadsheets). The file type needs to correspond to what Google offer as available [ViewIds](https://developers.google.com/picker/docs/reference#ViewId).

For usage documentation and a visual example, visit the style guide for Google Drive Picker [here](http://rise-vision.github.io/style-guide/#/components/google-drive-picker).

Google Drive Picker works in conjunction with [Rise Vision](http://www.risevision.com), the [digital signage management application](http://rva.risevision.com/) that runs on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.

## Built With
- Nodejs 6.17.1
- NPM (node package manager)
- Angularjs
- Gulp
- Bower
- Karma and Mocha for testing

## Development

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation

* install the latest Node.js and NPM version, run this to install:

* clone the repo using Git to your local:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rise-Vision/component-google-drive-picker.git
```

* cd into the repo directory
```bash
cd component-google-drive-picker
```

* from the root of the repo run this command to install all npm dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

* install Bower globally using the NPM install cmd:
```bash
npm install -g bower
```

* run Bower install to install all bower dependencies:
```bash
bower install
```

* install Gulp globally using the NPM install cmd:
```bash
npm install -g gulp
```

### Run Local

To preview the Google Drive Picker component in a browser, you can do so by using a Gulp task that is also internally used by the gulp test task (see Testing section below). Do the following:
```bash
gulp e2e:server
```

This now runs a local server at http://localhost:8099 which allows you to view the location of the E2E test HTML file at http://localhost:8099/test/e2e/ng-google-drive-picker-scenarios.html

### Dependencies

* **Gulp** - is used as a task runner. It lints, runs unit tests and E2E (end to end) tests, minimizes files, etc.  all dependencies for this is in the gulp.js file.
* **Bower** - is used as a package manager for javascript libraries and frameworks. All third-party javascript frameworks and libraries are listed as dependencies in the bower.json file.
* **NPM & Nodejs** - the node package manager is used in hand in hand with gulp to start a server to host the app and all the dependencies needed from using a node server. All these node dependencies are listed in the package.json file

### Testing

To run unit and E2E testing, do
```bash
gulp test
```
